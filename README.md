Plant Disease Classifier
Overview
This project is a plant disease classifier built using the Keras deep learning framework. The model is trained to identify various plant diseases based on input images of plant leaves.

Features
Disease Classification: The classifier can identify different plant diseases from images.
Keras Implementation: Built using Keras, making it easy to understand and extend.
Pre-trained Model: The project includes a pre-trained model that you can use out of the box.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Install dependencies using the following command:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-classifier.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd plant-disease-classifier
Run the classifier:

bash
Copy code
python classify_disease.py path/to/your/image.jpg
Replace path/to/your/image.jpg with the path to the image you want to classify.

Model Training
If you want to train the model on your own dataset, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset and organize it into the appropriate directories (e.g., train, validation, test).

Configure the model parameters in train_model.py such as batch size, number of epochs, etc.

Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Once training is complete, the model will be saved, and you can use it for classification.
